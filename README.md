# UC-Department-Analysis

Final project for Statistics 133 at UC Berkeley. 

* Worked with members to scrape individual and departmental salaries of University of California employees. 
* Discovered significant pay differences between athletic vs. academic; UCOP vs. UC system by analyzing over 8 million-employee records.

I learned how to acquire my own data, create fancy graphs, and figure out that if not a data scientist, I'm going to become an athletic coach at a college.
